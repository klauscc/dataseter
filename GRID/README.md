# GIRD

## 1. What is GRID?
GRID is a large multitalker audiovisual sentence corpus to support joint computational-behavioral studies in speech perception. In brief, the corpus consists of high-quality audio and video (facial) recordings of 1000 sentences spoken by each of 34 talkers (18 male, 16 female). Sentences are of the form "put red at G9 now".  The corpus, together with transcriptions, is freely available for research use. GRID is described in more detail in this paper.
